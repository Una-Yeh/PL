Data visualization is commonly used to spur idea generation across teams. They are 
frequently leveraged during brainstorming or Design Thinking sessions at the start of a 
project by supporting the collection of different perspectives and highlighting the 
common concerns of the collective. While these visualizations are usually unpolished and 
unrefined, they help set the foundation within the project to ensure that the team is 
aligned on the problem that theyâ€™re looking to address for key stakeholders.
